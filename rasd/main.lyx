Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Purpose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This document is the Requirement Analysis and Specification Document for
 the PowerEnJoy application.
 Its aim is to completely describe the system to be developed and to lay
 out functional and non-functional requirements, constraints, relationships
 with the external world, and typical use cases describing user interactions
 that the software must provide.
 Moreover, this document will provide formal specification of some features
 of the applications, written in Alloy language.
 This document is written for project managers, developers, testers and
 software designers.
 It may be used in a contractual agreement between software suppliers and
 customers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system supports a car-sharing service employing electric cars.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system consists of a server application (PowerEnJoy Server), a web applicati
on front-end (PowerEnJoy Web) and in a mobile application (PowerEnJoy Mobile).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system has the customer of the car-sharing service as its only type
 of user.
 It must allow them to subscribe to the service and identify themselves
 with their credentials.
 Only registered users should be able to make use of the service.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system can show users the location of available cars.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system allows users to reserve an available car for a limited amount
 of time.
 A user has to be able to tell to the system he/she is near the previously
 reserved car via mobile app or SMS in order to unlock it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system should keep track of information related to every active and
 completed ride.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system shouldn't allow users to know the position of cars that are not
 available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system allows users to pay for the service at the end of each ride,
 by communicating with a third party digital payment system.
 The system should prevent users who failed to pay due to insufficient funds
 from using the service until they pay off their debt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system promotes diligent behaviour of drivers by applying a discount
 on the fare.
 The system should charge the user an additional fee when a car is unnecessarily
 reserved or when, at the end of the ride, the car is left in a state requiring
 specific intervention by PowerEnJoy employees.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system interacts with PowerEnJoy employees in order to notice them when
 a car needs to be recharged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system is provided with an optional module:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Money saving option
\series default
 allows the driver to specify the destination of the ride.
 The system will then suggest an optimal charging area to park at, in order
 to get a discount on the fare.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Scenarios identification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Scenario 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stefano resides in a student campus in Milan.
 He wants to go to a concert, but there is a public transport strike until
 11 p.m.
 and unfortunately the concert starts at 10 p.m.; so, he decides to reserve
 a vehicle with PowerEnJoy to get there.
 Since he has used the service before, he is already registered and, well
 aware of the reservation time constraints, he reserves a car parked just
 100 meters far at 7.30 p.m..
 He leaves at 8.30 p.m.
 and reaches its destination one hour later.
 He has already been there, so he knows that there is a power grid station
 nearby, but unfortunately he finds it full: in fact, several other people
 have had his same idea of using the car sharing service to bypass the strike.
 Luckily, he finds a parking spot just 50 meters far from the power grid
 station and leaves the car there, with 40% of the battery still available.
 On the way back, the transport strike is finished, so he manages to take
 the train.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Scenario 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Giacomo and Francesca need to go to the shopping centre to get food for
 the week, but their car is broken.
 They decide to reserve a car with PowerEnJoy to get there.
 This is their first time using the service, so Giacomo has to register
 to it; then he logs and reserves a car after having searched among the
 nearest ones to his position.
 He also enables the money saving option and inserts the shopping center
 address.
 A few minutes later, one of Giacomo's friend, Marco, asks him if he can
 have a lift to the shopping centre.
 Giacomo agrees, and he, Francesca and Marco start their trip and get to
 their destination in just fifeteen minutes, so the car still has 75% of
 the battery available.
 Giacomo leaves the car in the power grid station and plugs the car to charge
 the battery, so he gets a total of 30% discount on the ride.
 Giacomo reserves the car again, since it will take them just 30 minutes
 to buy what they need.
 After having done the shopping, Giacomo, Francesca and Marco go back home
 and Giacomo leaves the car in a parking spot, because this time he has
 forgot to enable the money saving option and he isn't able to find a station.
 The car still has 75% of the battery available, so he gets a 20% discount
 on the ride.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Scenario 3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Michele is a college student and he is trying to save money as much as possibile
 since he is very tight on money at the moment.
 Therefore he decides to reserve a PowerEnJoy car to go to university enabling
 the money saving option.
 He is accustomed to using PowerEnJoy so he just logs in and reserves the
 nearest car without modifying his billing information.
 That day the traffic jam gets him stuck for a long time so that by the
 time he reaches college he is charged with 11EUR.
 Unfortunately Michele is unaware of having only 10EUR on his prepaid card
 used as payment method, so the payment transaction goes wrong and the system
 blocks the user linked to Michele until he will pay off his debt.
 Michele won't be able to get back home with a PowerEnJoy car by the end
 of the lessons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Scenario 4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alessio is a college student who, during his spare time, goes to the gym.
 He needs a medical certificate for this activity, so he has arranged a
 doctor's appointment during the 2 hours break between two lectures on Monday,
 that is the only gap Alessio could find inside his very busy weekly schedule.
 On that day, before the first lecture, he thought that he may not get back
 in time if he took public transport for the whole round trip, so he decided
 to reserve a car with PowerEnJoy at least to get there much faster.
 At 10 a.m.
 he reserves a car near the university.
 Unfortunately, he has forgotten that car reservation lasts up to one hour
 before picking it up and the break starts only at 12 a.m..
 Alessio receives a fine of 1 EUR for not having abided by the car reservation
 time constraint and he will have to reserve a car again if he wants to
 get quickly to his appointment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Scenario 5
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mattia is a student who is keen on Drum and Bass music.
 He would really like to go to a gig tonight but his parents left him home
 alone with no car.
 He chooses to reserve a PowerEnJoy car.
 He needs as well to pick his ticket at the mall, which is on the way to
 the gig.
 He is in a hurry when he gets out, but he manages to find a very near car.
 The ticket shop is right at the entrance to the mall, so he just stops
 his car nearby not to waste much time.
 He forgets that as he turns off the car PowerEnJoy charges him with the
 proper fare and turns the car into available to the clients.
 Fortunately the car is still there once he gets back, but he needs to make
 another reservation for the same car.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Future extensions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system will be implemented foreseeing the possibility of further extensions,
 for example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Create a fidelity score for every user, which gives them the opportunity
 to benefit from special offers.
 The score increases every time the user drives a PowerEnJoy electric car,
 proportionally with the time spent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Implement a report system so that users can signal to PowerEnJoy vehicles
 that are damaged, very dirty, or generally not fit for use.
